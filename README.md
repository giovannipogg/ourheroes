# ourheroes
Project for the Deep Natural Language Processing course offered by Politecnico di Torino A.Y. 2021/2022.

The Project aims at reproducing and extending the HEROES model as described by Zhu et al. in the paper "Summarizing 
"Summarizing Long-Form Document with Rich Discourse Information".

The `ourheroes` package can be installed via `pip install ourheroes`, and the documentation can be read at https://giovannipogg.github.io/ourheroes/ourheroes.html.

To reproduce the experiments one needs first to run the `ourheroes.inspection.inspect_files.py` script and the `files/Inspect.ipynb` to obtain the filtered dataset, then one can proceed by running `experiments.py`.

The `beta` version of the program was exploited for our first batch of experiments, however we cannot guarantee for it work off-the-shelf. For further information please refer to the project report `NLP_Project___Summarization.pdf`.
